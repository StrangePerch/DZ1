<h2>What is HTML?</h2>
<p>
    <span class="thumbnail">Hypertext Markup Language <span class="html">(HTML)</span>
    </span> is the standard markup language for creating web pages and web applications.
</p>
<p>
    Web browsers receive <span class="html">HTML</span> documents from a web server or from local storage and
    render the documents into multimedia web pages. <span class="html">HTML</span> describes the structure of
    a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the
    document.
</p>
<p>
    HTML elements are the building blocks of <span class="html">HTML</span> pages. 
    With <span class="html">HTML</span> constructs, images and other objects such 
    as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. 
    <span class="html">HTML</span> provides a means to create structured documents
    by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, 
    links, quotes and other items. <span class="html">HTML</span> elements are 
    delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such as 
    <span class="html_tag">&ltimg/></span> and <span class="html_tag">&ltinput/></span> directly
    introduce content into the page. Other tags such as <span class="html_tag">&ltp></span>
    surround and provide information about document text and may include other tags
    as sub-elements. Browsers do not display the HTML tags, but use them to interpret
    the content of the page.

<h2>Markup</h2>
<p>
    <span class="html">HTML</span> markup consists of several key components, including those 
    called <i>tags</i> (and their <i>attributes</i>), character-based <i>data types</i>, 
    <i>character references</i> and <i>entity references</i>. <span class="html">HTML</span> tags most
    commonly come in pairs like <span class="html_tag">&lth1></span> and<span class="html_tag">&lt/h1></span>,
    although some represent <i>empty elements</i> and so are unpaired, for example 
    <span class="html_tag">&ltimg></span>. The first tag in such a pair is the <i>start tag</i>, and 
    the second is the <i>end tag</i> (they are also called <i>opening tags</i> and <i>closing tags</i>).
